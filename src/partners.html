					<h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>

					<p>Ruby on Rails<sup>&reg;</sup> is an open-source web framework that’s optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. So let’s write beautiful code and favor convention over configuration.</p>

					<h3>Pivotal Tracker</h3>

					<p>We love the simplicity of PT. You brainstorm into the ice box. Prioritize stories into the backlog. Estimate each story. Start a story. Finish a story. Deliver a story. Then the customer can either accept or reject a story. The simplicity is genius. It allows us to effectively manage large projects and keep visibility high and expectations tight.</p>

					<h3>Configuration <br />Managment with Chef</h3>

					<p>Chef provides developers, especially Ruby developers, with a method for programming their infrastructure. This turns out to be invaluable. At Particle41 we use Chef in some rather adventurous ways that allow us a lot of flexibility when designing our infrastructure.</p>

				<div class="partner-content">
					<h3>Slack</h3>

					<p>We use Slack<sup>&reg;</sup> because it helps our team if everyone is made aware of what’s going on in all sides of the business in order to either interject, ask a question, or for individuals to plan their own work around what was being done elsewhere. We integrate most of our tools together with slack to reduce the team’s reliance on email reserving it for truly important communication.</p>
