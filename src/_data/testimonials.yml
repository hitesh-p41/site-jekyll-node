  client_comment: "I've had the pleasure of working with the Particle41 team on two different projects spanning over 24 months. At every stage of development I've found them to be easy to work with, exceptionally creative and forward thinking. The integrity they bring to their work is obvious and the results the team provides far exceeds the level of innovation, aesthetics and intuitive design than I could have ever envisioned without them!"

  client_comment: "Particle41 was able to take over devlopement of our application and fix alot of preexisiting architectural flaws.  They optimized our AWS environment which saved us a ton of money. They made the whole developement process more efficient and productive.  We have accomplished more in the past six months with Particle41 than we did in the prior two years with a previous team.  I look forward to what I hope is a very long term relationship with Particle41 and all future software efforts I represent."
