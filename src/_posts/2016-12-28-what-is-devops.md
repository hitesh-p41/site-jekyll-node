### DevOps __Explained__

The old paradigm in the IT industry was to split the development into two groups, the Software Development group and the Operations group. The software group was involved with writing code, implementing code, testing code and rewriting code. The operations group was involved with the systems needed to run the software, including having enough processing power, security, and efficiency and keep them all running.

While both teams may be in the same building, like Congress, they are in different rooms and rarely talk. This means the development process is drawn out over a long period of time and requires a lot of back and forth between the two teams.

DevOps brings all the players into one room (figuratively anyways) where one team is together for the entire life cycle of the project. Each team member uses the same technologies, the same code, and the same principles making for a smoother, more consistent, process and mutual cooperation. There is a sense of empathy between the teams.

This team approach leads to better and more efficient communication between not only the development and operations teams but the other teams in the organization.

### Why __you need DevOps?__

There are many benefits of a DevOps approach. These include:
- Continuous updating and deployment meaning getting your software to market faster.
- Because everyone is working together, there is a lower failure rate.
- Faster time to recovery when something does go wrong.
- Less complex problems and a faster resolution due to instant communication.
- Operating systems are more stable.
- More time to add value, less time to fix and maintain.

At Particle41 we work as equal partners with your team and our partners to develop your new systems, upgrade your old ones, and continuously monitor them ensuring they work smoothly and are upgraded with as little disruption as possible. Where teams traditionally conducted releases monthly or weekly. We feel modern competition requires that changes or varying levels of complexity happen daily or hourly giving companies the ability to make changes as soon as they are approved.
