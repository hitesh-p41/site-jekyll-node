heading: Payments <strong>Lending and POS Integration</strong>
heading_text: Particle41 partnered with Old Union Financial to build an integrated loan payment and lending portal.
---

<p>
We implemented a portal that allows the user to pay their loans online. We integrated with a lenders POS system and are able to securely pass payment information to the lender in real time. The project also allows businesses to become lenders. The system connects over 50,000 home owners with servicer providers that offer deferred payment on services like heating and Air Conditioning and roof repair. For this solution we used Amazon Web Services (AWS), Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, and some “Particle41 elbow grease”. This project was made possible by our friends at Global Images Design.
