<p>We created a mechanism for deploying a cluster of ads into another ad. The solution allow marketers to use one ad space but be able to optimize and A/B test a collection of bylines to determine which performs best. A Ruby application was created to better deploy the tags and assisted with data lifting to help with migrating an old data scheme to the new one.</p>
