heading_text: Particle41 partnered with juviGAP Ministries to build an automated SMS reminder system for at-risk youth.
---

<p>
By combining Twilio and Salesforce, JuviGap was able to fully automate a free SMS service that helps youth who are on probation of their court-ordered obligations. It reminds them of specific tasks that they have to accomplish to help them stay on track, and achieve successful probation outcomes. The product was so successful it allowed the .org to move from supporting 3 districts to supporting 13 districts in less than a year.

<p>
With JuviGap, we made a mobile ready form with Ruby On Rails. Created middleware REST API in Salesforce.com to recieve the data from the Rails Application. Twilio was then integrated to send SMS messages.
