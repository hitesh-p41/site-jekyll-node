<p>We created a volunteer portal that allows nonprofit staff and volunteers to work together to prepare for mission trips to Honduras and Nicaragua. The project reduced manual coordination provides an efficient way to communicate and collect vital information. We used Ruby on rails, Angular and bootstrap for the portal. We integrated with Salesforce Stripe and Braintree.</p>
